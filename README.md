# Stock Market Kafka Real-Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction 
This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering solution for real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka. The goal is to build a data pipeline for real-time data ingestion, storage, and processing.

Technologies used include Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL. This project demonstrates how to manage and process stock market data efficiently in real-time.

## Architecture
The architecture involves:

Kafka Producer: Streams real-time stock market data to Kafka.
Kafka Consumer: Reads data from Kafka and stores it in AWS S3.
AWS Glue & Athena: Used for data cataloging and querying stored data in S3.
EC2 Instances: Hosts Kafka and the data pipeline on AWS infrastructure
